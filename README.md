# Julia-Miscellaneous
This Repo contains a miscellaneous of Julia functions that I write to test my codes.


  * `constrained-optimization.jl`: shows how to optimize a function s.t. (non-)linear constraints with an aribitrary number of inputs
  * `obj-fun-with-gradient.jl`: shows how to optimize a function and provide analytical gradient in various ways
  * `system-nonlinear-equations-solver.jl`: solves system of non-linear equations (declared as non-linear constraint in optim)
